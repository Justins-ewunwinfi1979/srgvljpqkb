Just stepped out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Alarum and honestly, I’m not sure if I’m more dazzled or dazed. I mean, I went in for some mindless flick to keep my thoughts distracted, but apparently, I signed up for the emotional equivalent of a rollercoaster at a cheese fondue party.

First thing's first, the soundtrack was like being trapped in a kaleidoscope while someone whispers secrets you’re almost sure you didn’t want to know. My ears feel like they need a couple of days at a wellness retreat just to recover. Somehow, the   was both a lullaby and an alarm clock — not sure how they managed that one.

And don’t get me started on the visuals. It was like if Salvador Dalí had decided to direct a fireworks show. Too much, yet also kind of mesmerizing. If I have weird dreams tonight, I’m definitely blaming every insane scene I just witnessed. There was one part where I couldn’t tell if the protagonist was about to find redemption or eat an entire loaf of bread, but honestly, who can tell these days?

> So, the plot. Right. Maybe you’d need an alien brain to fully comprehend it. I almost want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to pause every three seconds and consult a spiritual guide or Google translate. But for some weird reason, I also kind of loved the chaos. Life isn't a neatly wrapped package, anyway — it’s a cluttered junk drawer of experiences.

Am I annoyed? Yeah, a bit. Did I love it? Maybe. The feelings are like coffee grounds in a French press — still settling. I don’t know what the director was on, but I might need some to fully appreciate the genius or madness of it all.

𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you’re into the unpredictable and have strong feelings about scrambled narratives with a side of existential questions. Or if you like an artful headache. But not a bad headache — the kind that makes you see colors in your dreams. Maybe. Who knows? I’m still figuring out if I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 a   or had a shared hallucination with the rest of the audience.
